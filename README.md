# DataScience

Hi guys, this will be my first project in Data Science. Although this is just a dummy project, I learned a lot, especially when I use my database on MySQL in Python(in this case, I use PyCharm).

This project is already done, but need time to prepare to submit it to github. since this is my first time using this, so I'll learn about this stuff too.

And some code, i use my language (which is Indonesia) in my variable. in case some foreign guy wants to take a look at my bad code.
