|Analysis and Visualization of Global 3D Movie Audience Trends|

📌 Project Description
This project analyzes and visualizes global trends in 3D movie audiences based on a manually created dataset using MySQL. 
The analysis includes comparisons between production budgets and revenues, audience distribution, and revenue trends of 3D movies over time.

🛠️ Analysis Methods
1. Data Extraction = Data is retrieved from MySQL using `Extract_Database.py`.
2. Data Visualization =  `Visualization_Analysis.py` is used to generate various charts and insights.
3. Types of Visualizations:
   - Budget vs. Revenue Comparison(`budget_vs_revenue.html`)
   - Revenue Trends Over the Years(`trend_revenue.html`)
   - Audience Distribution by Region(`viewer_distribution.html`)

📊 Analysis Results
Based on the conducted analysis, several interesting insights about 3D movie trends have been uncovered:

🔹 Budget vs. Revenue Correlation
- Movies with higher production budgets tend to generate higher revenues.
- Some low-budget films managed to achieve significant profits, indicating that factors such as marketing strategy and genre popularity also play a role.
- The visualization reveals outliers where certain high-budget films did not achieve significant profits.

🔹 Revenue Trends Over the Years
- Revenue analysis shows a significant increase in 3D movie earnings during the early 2010s, likely due to advancements in 3D technology and rising popularity of the format.
- After peaking in the mid-decade, revenue stabilized with minor fluctuations, indicating that 3D technology became an industry standard.
- The highest-grossing years often coincide with the release of major blockbuster franchises.

🔹 Audience Distribution by Region
- North America and Asia have the highest number of viewers (based on Box Office Mojo data), reflecting Hollywood’s dominance and the growing consumption of films in Asian countries.
- Europe also has a significant audience base, though it remains more stable compared to other regions.
- South America and Africa show slower growth, likely due to cinema infrastructure and purchasing power factors.
- The data suggests that region-specific distribution and marketing strategies can significantly boost audience numbers.
- The analysis used here still uses several countries that have the highest revenue (based on Box Office Mojo data) and my own country, 
  so it is still possible to add various countries from other continents so that the comparison can be more accurate.


📝 Additional Notes
- There are several codes that I'm still confused about, for example, regarding the 'Audience Distribution Based on Region' code. 
I've tested in many ways so that the code can reveal the entire region that I created before, but somehow, only the USA appeared. Need to learn this advance.
- Consider adding more genres for more variety so they can be compared with each other.
- Consider adding more regions for more variety.

📢 Contributions and Future Improvements
- To enhance this project, consider adding a larger dataset or incorporating machine learning models to predict the success of 3D movies based on various factors.
